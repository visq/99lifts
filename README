99lifts
=======
The goal of this small project is to reimplement Martin Schoeberl's Lift Controller[1] 
in a few radically different languages or platforms for hard real-time systems.

All kind of contributions are of course most welcome !

Status
------

In addition to the original code, which is written for Embedded Java, I've implemented 
a variant in Lucid Synchrone [2]. The Lucid variant includes a simulator, which is 
well suited to demonstrate how to system works.

Here is a list of other interesting targets, in decreasing order of my personal interest:
 - atom [3]
 - SystemJ [4]   (requires free-of-charge license)
 - Lustre v6 [5,6] (C backend requires free-of-charge license)
 - Ptolemy II variants [7]
 - Simulink+Stateflow+Embedded Coder [8] (commercial) 

Implementations
---------------
java-orig              ... The original implementation
lucid-simple           ... An implementation in lucid synchrone. Does not use
                           multi-domain clocks. Includes simulator and visuals.
