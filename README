99lifts
=======
The goal of this small project is to reimplement Martin Schoeberl's Lift Controller[1]
in a few radically different languages or platforms for hard real-time systems.

All kind of contributions are of course most welcome !

Status
------

In addition to the original code, which is written for Embedded Java, I've implemented
a variant in Lucid Synchrone [2]. The Lucid variant includes a simulator, which is
well suited to demonstrate how to system works.

Second, the code was ported to C, and used in various research projects (such as the F-Shell Testcase generator [9]).

Here is a list of other interesting targets, in decreasing order of my personal interest:

 - atom [3]
 - Ptolemy II variants [7]
 - Simulink+Stateflow+Embedded Coder [8] (commercial)
 - Lustre v6 [5,6] (C backend requires free-of-charge license)
 - SystemJ [4]   (requires free-of-charge license)

Implementations
---------------
java-orig              ... The original implementation
lucid-simple           ... An implementation in lucid synchrone. Does not use
                           multi-domain clocks. Includes simulator and visuals.
c-port                 ... straighforward port of the original implementation to C
